# Step 1: Initial Issues
doc.add_heading('Step 1: Identified Issues in XAMPP Control Panel', level=3)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "1. Opened the XAMPP Control Panel, which showed:\n"
    "   - Apache was running on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS).\n"
    "   - The logs showed Apache was successfully started but there was an issue accessing HTTPS due to the default configuration.\n\n"

    "[main] Running with Administrator rights - good!\n"

# Step 2: Configured SSL
doc.add_heading('Step 2: Configured SSL', level=3)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "1. Generated SSL Certificate:\n"
    "   - Used OpenSSL from the Apache bin directory to generate a self-signed SSL certificate:\n"
    "     D:\\xampp\\apache\\bin\\openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server.key -out server.crt -config D:\\xampp\\apache\\conf\\openssl.cnf\n"
    "   - Provided placeholder information during the certificate generation process.\n\n"
    "2. Placed Certificates:\n"
    "   - The generated server.key and server.crt files were placed in the directory:\n"
    "     D:\\xampp\\apache\\conf\n\n"
    "3. Edited Apache Configuration:\n"
    "   - Opened httpd-ssl.conf located in D:\\xampp\\apache\\conf\\extra.\n"
    "   - Updated the SSL certificate paths:\n"
    "     SSLCertificateFile \"D:/xampp/apache/conf/server.crt\"\n"
    "     SSLCertificateKeyFile \"D:/xampp/apache/conf/server.key\"\n"
    "   - Verified that SSLEngine on was enabled and that the server was listening on port 443."

# Step 4: Tested HTTP and HTTPS

doc.add_paragraph(
    "1. HTTP (http://localhost):\n"
    "   - Opened the browser and accessed http://localhost, which successfully loaded the XAMPP dashboard.\n\n"
    "2. HTTPS (https://localhost):\n"
    "   - Opened the browser and accessed https://localhost, which displayed a browser warning:\n"
    "     NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID\n"
    "   - Clicked Advanced > Proceed to localhost (unsafe), and the XAMPP dashboard loaded successfully."

# Step 5: Verified Ports and Processes
doc.add_heading('Step 5: Verified Ports and Processes', level=3)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "1. Verified that Apache was listening on ports 80 and 443 using netstat:\n"

    "2. Confirmed the Apache executable path using:\n"
    "   wmic process where \"ProcessId=2204\" get ExecutablePath\n\n"
